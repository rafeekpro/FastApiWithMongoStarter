### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing code style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-mongodb-starter.git
   cd fastapi-mongodb-starter
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

6. Run MongoDB using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d mongodb
   ```

### Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

* **Black** for code formatting (line length: 120)
* **Ruff** for linting
* **mypy** for type checking

Before committing, run:
```bash
black app tests
ruff check app tests --fix
mypy app
```

Or let pre-commit handle it automatically.

### Testing

Write tests for any new functionality. We aim for >80% test coverage.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_schemas.py

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commits specification:

* `feat:` New feature
* `fix:` Bug fix
* `docs:` Documentation changes
* `style:` Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
* `refactor:` Code refactoring
* `test:` Adding or updating tests
* `chore:` Maintenance tasks
* `perf:` Performance improvements

Examples:
```
feat: add user authentication endpoint
fix: resolve database connection timeout issue
docs: update API documentation for movies endpoint
test: add unit tests for movie service
```

### Documentation

* Keep README.md up to date
* Document all API endpoints
* Add docstrings to all functions and classes
* Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes

### Branch Naming

* `feature/` for new features (e.g., `feature/user-auth`)
* `fix/` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/db-connection`)
* `docs/` for documentation (e.g., `docs/api-update`)
* `refactor/` for refactoring (e.g., `refactor/service-layer`)
